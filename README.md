In this project we have cloned [this](https://web.archive.org/web/20210120125445/https://www.newsweek.com/) Newsweek web page using Bootstrap. We have implemented HTML5 and a little bit CSS as most of the styles come from Bootstrap. Also, instead of using Media Queries for responsiveness, we have used predefined classes from Bootstrap. 

## Built With

- HTML5
